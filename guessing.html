    <h1>Number guessing game</h1>

    <p>
      We have selected a random number between 1 and 100. See if you can guess
      it in 10 turns or fewer. We'll tell you if your guess was too high or too
      low.

      // I know it has many bugs, but it was the first time I tried to write all by myself and think of the code with
      // my own made up logic, just a little help from gpt sometimes to find a error or remember how something is written

      /*I want you to create a simple "guess the number" type game. It should choose a random number between
      1 and 100, then challenge the player to guess the number in 10 turns. After each turn, the player should
      be told if they are right or wrong, and if they are wrong, whether the guess was too low or too high.
      It should also tell the player what numbers they previously guessed. The game will end once the player
      guesses correctly, or once they run out of turns. When the game ends, the player should be given an option
      to start playing again.*/
