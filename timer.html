    <!--Concurrency in computer science is the ability to handle multiple tasks at once, 
    not necessarily completing them simultaneously, but by rapidly switching between them or executing 
    them in a way that creates the illusion of simultaneous progress.
    Timer deals with concurrency in the sense that a timer process that updates the elapsed time 
    runs concurrently to the userâ€™s interactions with the GUI application.-->

    - adjusting slider must immediatly affect duration, not only when slider is released-
    - also affects gauge immediatly when slider
    - when label is equal or bigger than duration then timer stops (gauge will be full)
    - if thereafter duration is increased such that duration is bigger than label, it restarts until previous sentence is fulfilled
    - clicking resetButton do the obvious-->
